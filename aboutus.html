  Our project will aim to provide STEM enrichment opportunities to middle school aged students to adults, 
  especially those that are educationally disadvantaged. With individuals in science, technology, engineering, 
  and mathematical fields underrepresented, it is critical for students to participate in competitions, research 
  lab apprenticeships, and scholarships within the STEM fields to stay competitive and engaged. However, according 
  to annual evaluation data by Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP), reports have indicated that many students 
  that participate in these programs are from underprivileged urban areas and do not have access to strong research 
  design and statistical instruction necessary to fully utilize these opportunities. 
<br><br>
  Our project is to create a multi-module web interface that will provide interactive content, teaching statistics on 
  an easy-to-use platform as a free, online educational resource. With this implemented, we can provide the teachings 
  necessary for students participating in STEM opportunities and hopefully eliminate the knowledge gap of statistics 
  in particular. On our website, we will be providing interactive modules to teach the content, labs to reinforce the 
  learning, and quizzes to test their understanding of the many modules that will be available. Our stakeholders, Professor 
  Toni Sondergeld of Drexel University and Dr. Gregory Stone of the University of Toledo and Chief Executive Officer of the 
  Metriks Amerique Group, will provide us with statistical content of our website. We will also be working with the Drexel 
  server team for the technical aspects of our project.
